# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-by-using-SQL
In this SQL project, using the deaths and vaccination data tables of Covid-19 from March 2020 to June 2021, I've done an exploratary analysis using basic to advanced SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

# Project Summary:
The "COVID-19 Data Analysis using SQL" project is a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using SQL queries to extract insights from relevant datasets. The project aims to provide a clear and organized analysis of the pandemic's impact, spread, and trends, utilizing the power of SQL for efficient data processing and exploration.

Key Objectives:

Data Collection: Gather COVID-19 datasets from reliable sources, including information about confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing, and vaccination progress. Ensure the data is up-to-date and accurate.

Database Design: Design a structured relational database to store the collected COVID-19 data. Create tables that appropriately represent different aspects of the pandemic, ensuring data normalization and consistency.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Cleanse the collected data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types as necessary. Transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis.

SQL Queries and Analysis: Write SQL queries to explore various dimensions of the pandemic, such as:

Daily, weekly, and monthly trends of new cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Geographic analysis of cases and mortality rates across countries, regions, or states.
Correlation between testing efforts and case numbers.
Vaccination coverage and its impact on infection rates.
Identification of hotspots and containment zones.
